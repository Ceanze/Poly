# Poly
A Vulkan Engine designed from scratch that is developed by me in my spare time.

## Purpose
The general purpose of this project is as a learning exerice for Vulkan, render graph, and for a more advanced engine and project. An ideal goal would be able to create simple games with the engine and to allow for multiple graphics API:s, however these features are not the main focus.

## Currently working on
  - Render graph - currently working with multiple passes, automatic sync, and internal resource creation and handling

## Features (few for the moment)
  - Vulkan API rendering
  - GLSL online compiler
  - Abstracted graphics layer
  
## Currently planned features
  - SPIR-V reflection to automatically generate a more usable interaction with shaders to avoid knowing sets and bindings
  - ImGui implementation with the render graph to allow for a more visual creation of it
  
## Code standard

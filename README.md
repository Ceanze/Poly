# Poly
A Vulkan Engine designed from scratch that is developed on by me on the freetime.

## Purpose
The general purpose of this project is to learn even more about Vulkan and on how to structure a more advanced project. One of the main structure ideas is to make support for multiple graphics API:s, even if only vulkan will be used, the purpose of this is to have it be a bit more challenging.

## Features (few for the moment)
  - Vulkan API rendering
  - GLSL online compiler
  
## Currently planned features
  - Simple render graph implementation (for the moment only the bare minimum to allow synchronization is planned)
  
## Code standard
